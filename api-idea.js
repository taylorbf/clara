/*
This is good...

Hitting enter executes & creates another text of the object, duplicating what exists.

When navigating the text area, the code knows which object i'm currently editing
    might be tough...

Can re-edit past objects

When stops looping, disappears? or stays there, dimmed, but can be "re-run" later
